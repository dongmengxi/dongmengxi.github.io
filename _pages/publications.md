I primarily work in the field of convex geometric analysis. I am particularly interested in the Minkowski-type problems for geometric measures obtained by "differentiating" geometric invariants. These problems generate Monge-Ampère equations on the unit sphere and can be tackled from a PDE point of view (e.g., geometric flow).

I am also interested in isoperimetric inequalities (both affine and non-affine, geometric and functional).
