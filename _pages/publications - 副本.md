I work in convex geometry. I am especially interested in the isoperimetric problems of geometric invariants, and the Minkowski problems for geometric measures. 

I am partially supported by a general program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (12071277), and a key program of the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (20JC1412600).

This page contains a list of peer-reviewed papers and preprints. It is updated periodically. You can also find my articles  on <u><a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/MRAuthorID/1060858">MathSciNet</a></u> (subscription required).
