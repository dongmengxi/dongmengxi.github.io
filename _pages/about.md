I am a C.L.E. Moore Instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My mentor is Professor David Jerison. I am on the job market this year (2020-2021).

My research interest lies in the intersection of convex geometric analysis and PDE. I am supported by NSF grant DMS-2002778.

Before coming to MIT, I was briefly at St. John's University as a full-time contract faculty at the rank of Assistant Professor.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from New York University in May, 2017. My dissertation advisors are: [Professor Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Professor Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Professor Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). I am in great debt to them for the many lessons (both academic and non-academic) they taught me.
