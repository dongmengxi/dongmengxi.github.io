I am an Assistant Professor at Syracuse University. 

I primarily work in convex geometry. I am particularly interested in solving Monge-Amp√®re type equations that come from a geometric background. I am also interested in sharp isoperimetric inequalities (geometric or functional). I am partially supported by a standard NSF grant: DMS-2002778, DMS-2132330 ($159,159.00, 06/2020---05/2023).

Before coming to SU, I was a C.L.E. Moore Instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My mentor was [Professor David Jerison](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=112).

I was briefly at St. John's University as a full-time contract faculty at the rank of Assistant Professor.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from New York University in May, 2017. My dissertation advisors were: [Professor Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Professor Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Professor Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). I am in great debt to them for the many lessons (both academic and non-academic) they taught me.
