I am Dongmeng Xi, an Associate Professor at Shanghai University. 

I primarily work in convex geometry, and I am especially interested in the isoperimetric problems for geometric invariants, and the Minkowski problems for geometric measures. I am partially supported by a general program of NSFC (12071277), and a key program of STCSM (20JC1412600).

I visited Courant institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University from November 2019 to January 2021. Before that, I used to be an exchanging Ph.D student from September 2014 to September 2015 at Polytechnic school of NYU. Both of the two visits were supported by CSC and NYU, and [Professor Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Professor Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Professor Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/) were my mentors. 

In 2017 and 2018 I was a postdoctoral fellow at Fudan University, and  Professor [Jixiang Fu](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=616042) was my mentor.  

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai University in October 2015, under the supervision of  Professor [Gangsong Leng](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=323352).
