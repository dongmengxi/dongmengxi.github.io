I am a C.L.E. Moore instructor at the Math department of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My primary research field is convex geometric analysis. I am particularly interested in geometric invariants, geometric measures, and their characterization problem (Minkowski-type problems). 

Prior to coming to MIT, I was briefly at St. John's University located in Queens, New York for a year as a contract faculty. 

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from New York University in May, 2017. My dissertation advisors are: [Dr. Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Dr. Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Dr. Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). I am in great debt to them for the many lessons (both academic and non-academic) they taught me.
