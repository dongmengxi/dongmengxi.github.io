I am Dongmeng Xi, an Associate Professor at Shanghai University. 

I work in convex geometry, and I am especially interested in the isoperimetric problems of geometric invariants, and the Minkowski problems for geometric measures. 

I am partially supported by a general program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (12071277), and a key program of the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (20JC1412600).

I visited Courant institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University from November 2019 to January 2021, partially supported by CSC and NYU. It was invited by [Professor Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Professor Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Professor Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). 
I used to be an exchanging Ph.D student from September 2014 to September 2015 at Polytechnic school of NYU, also supported by CSC and NYU, and Professors Erwin Lutwak, Deane Yang, and Gaoyong Zhang were my mentors.  
I am very greatful to them for sharing me the good viewpoints in convex geometry. 

In 2017 and 2018 I was a Postdoctoral fellow at Fudan University, and my mentor was Professor Jixiang Fu. He showed me a lot about the connections between the convex geometry and other fields. 

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai University in October 2015. My Ph.D. advisor is Professor Gangsong Leng, who is my mentor (both mathematical and spiritual) and close friend. I can never forget his kindness. If I had not met him, I may not have the opportunity to study mathematics.
