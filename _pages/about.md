Starting from Fall 2018, I will be at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a C.L.E. Moore Instructor. My primary research field is convex geometric analysis. I am particularly interested in geometric invariants, geometric measures, and their characterization problem (Minkowski-type problems).

Before coming to MIT, I was briefly at St. John's University as a full-time contract faculty at the rank of Assistant Professor.

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from New York University in May, 2017. My dissertation advisors are: [Dr. Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Dr. Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Dr. Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). I am in great debt to them for the many lessons (both academic and non-academic) they taught me.
