I am Dongmeng Xi, an Associate Professor at Shanghai University. 

I work in convex geometry, and I am especially interested in the isoperimetric problems of geometric invariants, and the Minkowski problems for geometric measures. I am partially supported by a general program of NSFC (12071277), and a key program of the STCSM (20JC1412600).

I visited Courant institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University from November 2019 to January 2021, supported by CSC and NYU. It was invited by [Professor Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Professor Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Professor Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). 
Before that, I used to be an exchanging Ph.D student from September 2014 to September 2015 at Polytechnic school of NYU, also supported by CSC and NYU, and Professors Lutwak, Yang, and Zhang were my advisors. 

In 2017 and 2018 I was a postdoctoral fellow at Fudan University, and my mentor was Professor [Jixiang Fu](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=616042).

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai University in October 2015. My Ph.D. advisor is Professor [Gangsong Leng](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=323352), a mentor  and close friend.  If I had not met him, I may not have the opportunity to study mathematics.
