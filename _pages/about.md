For the 2017-2018 Academic Year, I am a full-time contract faculty at the rank of Assistant Professor at St. John's University.

Starting from Fall 2018, I will be a C.L.E. Moore instructor at the Math department of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My primary research field is convex geometric analysis. I am particularly interested in geometric invariants, geometric measures, and their characterization problem (Minkowski-type problems). 

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mathematics from New York University in May, 2017. My dissertation advisors are: [Dr. Erwin Lutwak](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LUTWAK_Erwin.html), [Dr. Deane Yang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~yangd/), and [Dr. Gaoyong Zhang](https://cims.nyu.edu/~gaoyong/). I am in great debt to them for the many lessons (both academic and non-academic) they taught me.
