This page contains the recitation handouts for 18.01A. 

I tend to get too ambitious and include too many problems in the handouts than I can finish. When that happens, I will post solutions to the problems that we didn't discuss in class. Note that I won't post solutions to the problems that we have already talked about.

My office hour is Tues. 2pm -- 4pm at 2-361.
